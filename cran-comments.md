## R CMD check results

There were two NOTEs. 

There was one NOTE about this being a updated version of the package. The NOTE mentions three possible misspelled words, all of which are correctly spelled proper nouns or terms of art.

Win-builder reported one NOTE about large components, but these are just some sample text files for testing and demonstration purposes.
